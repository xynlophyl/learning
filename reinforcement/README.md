# learning:reinforcement
workspace for reinforcement learning algorithms and environments

## Directory
### gym [WORK IN PROGRESS]
Included within this project will be implementations of fundamental RL algorithms and strategies, such as: multi-armed bandits, policy/value iteration, DQN etc. Benchmarks will also be included to evaluate training + test performance.

### soccertwos
Examining interactions of cooperation/competition in the Unity ML-Agents SoccerTwos environment.
