### minitorch [WORK IN PROGRESS]
my implementation/solution for the diy teaching library minitorch

### fundamentals_DL [WORK IN PROGRESS]
implementations of fundamental deep learning models, such as: MLP (NumPy), CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformers, ADAM optimizer etc. Benchmarks for various tasks (e.g. MNIST classification) will also be added to evaluate and compare model performance.
